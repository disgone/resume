## Objective

I'm targeting a full-stack role to tackle both back-end and front-end challenges. I aim to contribute to a team that values code quality and continuous improvement. Writing code is where I excel, and I'm focused on a career that keeps me hands-on in the tech stack. While my preference leans towards remote roles, I'm open to in-office or hybrid setups if the role and location are a good fit.

## Professional Experience

### U.S. Bank  
**Lead Software Developer - May 2023**  
I lead a distributed team tasked with the phased modernization of a critical legacy web forms application to a more flexible cloud-first, modular architecture, enabling us to gradually shift away from the legacy application while minimizing operational disruption. It was my responsibility to offer architectural guidance and specify implementation approaches, while also both coding for business deliverables and crafting proof-of-concept solutions as blueprints for the team. Additionally, I participate in code reviews and planning sessions, fostering an environment of continuous learning and quality assurance through collaboration with an offshore development team.

The redesigned system adopts a microservices architecture, utilizing .NET 7/C#/MSSQL for the back end and a micro-frontend pattern with React for the front end. All components are deployed and run in a Kubernetes environment.

### GM Financial  
**Senior Software Developer III - July 2021 - May 2023**  
On the Mode team, I worked as a full-stack developer to build a cloud-first, direct-to-lender lending application. I engaged in a range of responsibilities, from developing third-party integrations to crafting REST APIs in a microservices architecture. Our services were event driven, using a combination of CRQS and RabbitMQ/IBM Websphre as our event brokers. I also contributed code to the front end, which followed a micro-frontend pattern using Angular 13. Additionally, help orchestrate setting up and maintaining our CI/CD pipelines via Azure DevOps, as well as implementing infrastructure-as-code with Terraform. The application is hosted on Azure, leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service for deployment and management.

**Application Architect - December 2019 - July 2021**  
As a technical leader for the Astra team, I helped steer the overarching technical and architectural direction for our applications. I collaborated closely with team leadership to prioritize business needs while translating business functional requirements into actionable technical requirements. I was hands-on in developing new features and libraries, and actively participated in daily code reviews. In addition, I led technical meetings to ensure alignment among development, QA, and business teams, collaborating on problem-solving and solution validation.

**Senior Software Developer III (Contract) - July 2018 - December 2019**  
As a software developer on the Astra team we were tasked with modernizing a legacy ASP.NET web forms app into an Angular single-page application. The role involved a wide range of technologies, including .NET 3.1/MSSQL for our web services, SSRS for reporting, SSIS for ETL and data ingestion, IBM Websphere for event handling, and MSSQL for data warehousing. Leveraging my expertise, I contributed to the development of scalable microservices, an efficient data architecture, and an intuitive user interface.

### Ambit Energy  
**Senior Software Developer - August 2014 - January 2018**  
In my role at Ambit, I was a subject-matter expert for product and rate services, focusing on the creation of fault-tolerant, highly-available, and performant web services within a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Alongside my team, I managed the lifecycle of versioned services and provided client SDKs via NuGet. This role was uniquely challenging due to the need to navigate frequently changing regulations across multiple U.S. states. I was also part of the pioneering team that launched Ambit's first international market in Japan. Technologically, we relied on a Microsoft-based stack, with C#/ASP.NET Web API/WCF and MSSQL Server on the back end, and ASP.NET MVC and ReactJS on the front end.

### Property & Casualty Management Systems
**Senior Software Developer - June 2013 - August 2014**  
I was tasked with modernizing PCMS's Atlas claims management platform from a monolithic VB/ASP.NET web forms architecture to a C#/ASP.NET core with a single-page application front-end. We aimed for a responsive and accessible design to ensure a smooth user experience on both web and mobile platforms. The effort involved breaking down code into shared libraries to create a modular architecture and transitioning existing features to RESTful web services. The tech stack for this project included C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, AngularJS, and MSSQL Server.

### HKS Architects
**Software Developer - April 2007 - June 2013**  
I embraced a multifaceted role, developing both internal and external websites and applications. I automated several labor-intensive manual processes, such as launching a promotion candidate tracking and balloting system. I also designed an application that bridged the gap between the accounting and project management systems, enabling project managers to make more accurate quarterly forecasts. In addition, I implemented an electronic pay stub feature into the payroll system, eliminating the need for printed, couriered pay stubs across all 28 regional offices, resulting in substantial time and cost savings.

### UCF Department of Information Systems Technology  
**Software Developer - April 2005 - April 2007**  
In my role on the ARGIS team, I was an active contributor to our research grant and project tracking system which was using ColdFusion, JavaScript, and MSSQL. I brought Photoshop renderings from our graphic designer to life using HTML and CSS, while ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, I was proactive in transitioning the project from outdated table-based designs to more forward-thinking semantic and CSS-based layouts.
