## Professional Experience

### U.S. Bank  
**Lead Software Developer - May 2023**  
I lead a distributed team tasked with the phased modernization of a critical legacy web forms application to a more flexible cloud-first, modular architecture, enabling us to gradually shift away from the legacy application while minimizing operational disruption. I contribute to architectural decisions and offer guidance on modern application development. I play a hands-on role, both coding for business deliverables and crafting proof-of-concept solutions as a blueprint for the team. Additionally, I participate in code reviews and planning sessions, fostering an environment of continuous learning and quality assurance through collaboration with an offshore development team.

The redesigned system adopts a microservices architecture, utilizing .NET 7/C#/MSSQL for the back end and a micro-frontend pattern with React for the front end. All components are deployed and run in a Kubernetes environment.

### GM Financial  
**Senior Software Developer III - July 2021 - May 2023**  
On the Mode team, I contributed as a full-stack developer to build a cloud-first, direct-to-lender lending application. I engaged in a range of responsibilities, from developing third-party integrations to crafting REST APIs in a microservices architecture. Our services were event driven, using a combination of CRQS and RabbitMQ/IBM Websphre as our event brokers. I also contributed code to the front end, which followed a micro-frontend pattern using Angular 13. Additionally, I was hands-on with setting up and maintaining our CI/CD pipelines via Azure DevOps, as well as implementing infrastructure-as-code with Terraform. The application is hosted on Azure, leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service for deployment and management.

**Application Architect - December 2019 - July 2021**  
As a technical leader for the Astra team, I helped steer the overarching technical and architectural direction for our applications. I collaborated closely with team leadership to prioritize business needs while translating business functional requirements into actionable technical requirements. I was hands-on in developing new features and libraries, and actively participated in daily code reviews. In addition, I led technical meetings to ensure alignment among development, QA, and business teams, collaborating on problem-solving and vetting the solutions I proposed.

**Senior Software Developer III (Contract) - July 2018 - December 2019**  
As a software developer on the Astra team we were tasked with modernizing a legacy ASP.NET web forms app into an Angular single-page application. The project involved a wide range of technologies, including .NET 3.1/MSSQL for our web services, SSRS for reporting, SSIS for ETL and data ingestion, IBM Websphere for event handling, and MSSQL for data warehousing. Leveraging my expertise, I contributed to the development of scalable microservices, an efficient data architecture, and an intuitive user interface.

### Ambit Energy  
**Senior Software Developer - August 2014 - January 2018**  
In my role at Ambit, I acted as a subject matter expert in developing and supporting distributed, fault-tolerant web services and applications within a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Our team was responsible for creating and maintaining versioned services and client packages (NuGet), serving various internal and external stakeholders. This role was uniquely challenging due to the need to navigate frequently changing regulations across multiple U.S. states. I was also part of the pioneering team that launched Ambit's first international market in Japan. Technologically, we relied on a Microsoft-based stack, with C#/ASP.NET Web API/WCF and MSSQL Server on the back end, and ASP.NET MVC and ReactJS on the front end.

### Property & Casualty Management Systems  
**Senior Software Developer - June 2013 - August 2014**  
I was responsible for modernizing PCMS's Atlas claims management platform, originally built as a monolithic VB/ASP.NET web forms application. The project involved migrating the core to C#/ASP.NET while converting the front-end to a single-page application. We aimed for a responsive and accessible design to ensure a smooth user experience on both web and mobile platforms. The effort involved breaking down code into shared libraries to create a modular architecture and moving existing features to RESTful web services. The tech stack for this work included C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, AngularJS, and MSSQL Server.

### HKS Architects  
**Software Developer - April 2007 - June 2013**  
As a member of the small IT department within a large architecture firm, I was entrusted with various responsibilities, including the development of both internal and external websites and applications. I successfully automated many time consuming manual processes, including creating a promotion candidate tracking and balloting system. I designed and built an application that integrated data between HKS’s accounting and project management systems, to allow project managers to forecast quarterly costs and needs. I also wrote and integrated an electronic pay stub process into HKS’s payroll system which contributed to significant time and cost savings, replacing the need for printed pay stubs that were previously couriered and hand-delivered to all 28 HKS regional offices.

### UCF Department of Information Systems Technology  
**Software Developer - April 2005 - April 2007**  
I was responsible for developing and maintaining various modules and features for the company’s flagship application, ARGIS (Coldfusion/JavaScript/MSSQL), a research grant and project tracking system. My role also encompassed implementing and coding user interface designs provided by the graphics department. I played a pivotal role in spearheading the adoption of semantic design and CSS-based web layouts, replacing the outdated table-based layouts, which led to a significant enhancement in design practices and overall user experience.
