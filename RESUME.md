## Professional Experience

<section class='no-break'>
### U.S. Bank  
**Lead Software Developer - May 2023**  
I lead a distributed team tasked with the phased modernization of a critical legacy web forms application to a more flexible cloud-first, modular architecture, enabling us to gradually shift away from the legacy application while minimizing operational disruption. It was my responsibility to offer architectural guidance and specify implementation approaches, while also both coding for business deliverables and crafting proof-of-concept solutions as blueprints for the team. Additionally, I participate in code reviews and planning sessions, fostering an environment of continuous learning and quality assurance through collaboration with an offshore development team.

The redesigned system adopts a microservices architecture, utilizing .NET 7/C#/MSSQL for the back end and a micro-frontend pattern with React for the front end. All components are deployed and run in a Kubernetes environment.

**Senior Software Developer III - July 2021 - May 2023**  
On the Mode team, I worked as a full-stack developer to build a cloud-first, direct-to-lender lending application. I engaged in a range of responsibilities, from developing third-party integrations to crafting REST APIs in a microservices architecture. Our services were event driven, using a combination of CRQS and RabbitMQ/IBM Websphere as our event brokers. I also contributed code to the front end, which followed a micro-frontend pattern using Angular 13. Additionally, help orchestrate setting up and maintaining our CI/CD pipelines via Azure DevOps, as well as implementing infrastructure-as-code with Terraform. The application is hosted on Azure, leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service for deployment and management.

### Ambit Energy  
**Senior Software Developer - August 2014 - January 2018**  
In my role at Ambit, I was a subject-matter expert for product and rate services, focusing on the creation of fault-tolerant, highly-available, and performant web services within a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Alongside my team, I managed the lifecycle of versioned services and provided client SDKs via NuGet. This role was uniquely challenging due to the need to navigate frequently changing regulations across multiple U.S. states. I was also part of the pioneering team that launched Ambit's first international market in Japan. Technologically, we relied on a Microsoft-based stack, with C#/ASP.NET Web API/WCF and MSSQL Server on the back end, and ASP.NET MVC and ReactJS on the front end.

### Property & Casualty Management Systems
**Senior Software Developer - June 2013 - August 2014**  
I was tasked with modernizing PCMS's Atlas claims management platform from a monolithic VB/ASP.NET web forms architecture to a C#/ASP.NET core with a single-page application front-end. We aimed for a responsive and accessible design to ensure a smooth user experience on both web and mobile platforms. The effort involved breaking down code into shared libraries to create a modular architecture and transitioning existing features to RESTful web services. The tech stack for this project included C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, AngularJS, and MSSQL Server.

### HKS Architects
**Software Developer - April 2007 - June 2013**  
I embraced a multifaceted role, developing both internal and external websites and applications. I automated several labor-intensive manual processes, such as launching a promotion candidate tracking and balloting system. I also designed an application that bridged the gap between the accounting and project management systems, enabling project managers to make more accurate quarterly forecasts. In addition, I implemented an electronic pay stub feature into the payroll system, eliminating the need for printed, couriered pay stubs across all 28 regional offices, resulting in substantial time and cost savings.
